      description:`Beginner students often think the poses and breathing is all there is to master in yoga class. Experienced yogis know that what we practice on our yoga mats is just the tip of the iceberg. As students begin to discover the many different and profound aspects of yoga, they soon discover that yoga is a way of life. It can be astonishing to see how applying yogic principles off the mat affects our asana practice. There are many simple and easy ways to incorporate a yoga lifestyle into your daily routine that can deepen your yoga practice and add benefits to your everyday life.

      Goals of a yogic lifestyle
      A yogic lifestyle encourages a conscious shift in our approach to life and our outlook on the world around us. 
      
      Tips for creating a successful yoga lifestyle
      Healthy Food ChoicesMake healthy food choices
      A yoga-friendly lifestyle means taking care of your body by making healthy food choices. The easiest way to do this is to increase your intake of vegetables and eating more fresh fruit. You may want to consider a vegan diet or another plant-based diet. Even going vegetarian a day or two a week can drastically improve your health. Breakfast is often the best place to start making changes in your diet.
      Hydrate properly
      This is very basic, but are you getting enough water? Drinking 8 glasses of water a day may seem like a lot, but it’s the best way to keep your skin and body healthy. Drinking water also helps wake up in the morning and keeps you going throughout the day. If you take Bikram or hot yoga classes, proper hydration is especially important.
      Establish a regular yoga practice
      A dedicated and frequent practice of yoga is essential to support and fuel all of the various ways to infuse yoga into your daily routine. While breathing exercises and the physical postures create a calm mind and a clear heart, other yoga paths are equally powerful and supportive. Raja and Jnana yoga are deeply meditative, reflective, and contemplative. Bhakti and Tantra yoga invoke devotion and are more ritual based. Karma yoga encourages selfless service and humility. Whatever paths you choose, find a way to establish and maintain a regular practice throughout the week.
      Stay active
      Your daily asana practice can lead to all kinds of health benefits, including better sleep, better circulation, heart rate, blood pressure, and better range of movement, muscle, and balance. Yet hatha yoga usually does not provide enough cardio and strength training for optimal health. Try adding other types of fitness and physical exercise—just 20 minutes three times a week is all you need. Staying active is also a fantastic way to de-stress and lift your mood and energy levels.

      description:`Many bodies of research support the healing effects of music. Our favorite melodies release dopamine, known as the feel-good hormone, which activates our brain’s pleasure and reward system. Music can have a positive, immediate impact on our mental state; fast tempos can psychologically and physiologically arouse us, helping energize us for the day. Slower, meditative tunes can help us to relax and lower our stress levels.

      “A small but growing body of scientific evidence suggests that music and other rhythmic stimuli can alter mental states in predictable ways and even heal damaged brains.” (Stanford) Neuroscientist and opera singer Indre Viskontas says, “Listening to calm music when you are anxious can also lower your heart rate, deepen your breathing, because now all of a sudden your brain is trying to sync up with the music and if the music has a slower pulse, then that slows down these other autonomic parts of your nervous system. So that’s why music can be very calming, and in fact, it’s surprising that you can listen to music before surgery and actually need less sedative.” (PBS)
      
      When I need to relax, I listen to the calm of “The Sea” by HAEVN to ground me. When I’m stressed, Le’Andria Johnson reminds me that “Better Days” are coming. When I want something festive, I play “Me Rehúso” by Danny Ocean.
      
      My favorite music artists are part of my support network I turn to, and as a community, there is something profound in sharing a part of ourselves. What I’ve learned this week is that a collaborative playlist is a fun way to destress and connect with one another on a deeper level.
      
      What songs make YOU feel good? Is there music you play when you need to lift your spirits or calm your mind?`,

       `Asia Cup 2023 Update!! In a game which had little consequence on the grandeur scale of things as far as the Asia Cup is concerned, Bangladesh edged past India by 6 runs to end their disappointing campaign on a high. After being put in to bat first, Bangladesh posted a competitive 265 with contributions from Shakib Al Hasan, Nasum Ahmed, and Towhid Hridoy.
 

      
       
       Here are the talking points from the Asia Cup 2023, Super 4s’ game between the two sides-
       1. Bangladesh batting finally steps up in Asia Cup 2023
       Throughout the Asia Cup, bar the Afghanistan game, the Bangladesh batting order has flattered to deceive. They lose wickets in a heap, put one partnership which seems to steady the ship, and then once again lose wickets in clusters. And when Shakib was dismissed for 80 with the score reading 162/6, it felt like another collapse was waiting to happen.

       2. Suryakumar Yadav fluffs another chance
       With the likes of Virat Kohli and Hardik Pandya rested with one eye on the final, this was Suryakumar Yadav’s best opportunity to make the full use of this chance that was afforded to him. And he began things like he meant business, with a smashing sweep shot off the first ball he faced. But that was as good as it got for him.
        
       
       IND v BAN, Asia Cup 2023: Suryakumar Yadav continues to struggle in ODIs,  wait for fifty continues - India Today
      
       
       3. Gill’s mature knock 
       While wickets were falling from one end and the other batters unable to come with any meaningful answers to the questions posed by the Bangladeshi spin quartet, Shubman Gill played in a league of his own and it felt like he was playing on an entirely different pitch altogether.
        
       
       The scorecard will show that Gill scored 121 in 133 balls, but it was a brilliantly composed knock which had an equal dose of caution as well as aggression. He kept one end by constantly milking the bowlers around for singles and twos, while chancing his arm at every opportunity he got. This was his slowest century among the ones he’s made in ODIs so far, but it was the best among the lot. Unfortunately it did not get the victory that it deserved.`,

       `I’ve been disappointed in almost all the launch events I’ve seen since we mainly moved to virtual events. Most aren’t that different than in-person events where the speaker(s) get up on stage and pontificate.

       Some use a lot of visual aids that help, but mostly, they showcase the same limitations as in-person events, so they struggle to hold an online audience, which can more easily be distracted than an in-person audience.
       
       I think last week’s Apple “Wonderlust” launch event was an example of how virtual launches should be done, and it was brilliantly executed. I’m not and likely never will be an Apple fan, but I like to call things as I see them. Last week’s launch presentation raised the bar for how to execute events like this.
       
       Let’s talk about that this week, and we’ll close with my Product of the Week, which must be either the new Apple Watch Ultra 2 or the new iPhone 15 Pro. I think the watch is the bigger deal, though, so it will be my Product of the Week.
       
       How Typical Product Launches Are Done
       I’m an ex-actor and ex-marketing director, so I used to teach a class on how to do presentations. Then, as now, it often seems that launch presentations are designed for the presenters as a task they are required to do. Instead of being selected for their presentation skills, presenters are chosen because of their titles.
       
       Presentations are generally created just short of the event and changed up to minutes beforehand so that people not trained on teleprompters get up on stage and showcase how little they rehearsed. Some rehearse adequately and do well, but they tend to be the exception rather than the rule.
       
       In addition, the content of most tech presentations is on the technology in the product, with little focus on what it might mean to a buyer or user. Even if the technology is visual in nature, the presenter is likely to show how the technology works rather than what it does. People in the audience who generally don’t want to understand the technology are left bored and not overly excited about the product.`,

        `‘Avatar 2’: Everything we know about the upcoming sci-fi epic

        In 2009, Avatar well and truly took over the world. For months all you could hear about was the unrivalled scope, incredible animation and immersive experience of the fantasy epic – and for good reason, at the time it felt groundbreaking. That was over a decade ago though, and director James Cameron has been talking about the sequels (yes, all four of them) consistently since, production on Avatar 2 ended in November 2019.
        
        As we all get ready to go back to Pandora for the next instalment – here’s everything you can expect to see in Avatar 2.
        
        Latest updates
        The first full-length trailer has now been released
        The film has unveiled its official poster, along with brand-new images
        What is the release date for Avatar 2?
        The film is set to be released in cinemas on December 22, 2022.
        
        Why has it taken so long?
        Advertisement
        Anyone who has tracked the production will know that the follow-up to 2009’s epic has been troubled to say the least.
        
        In 2006 Cameron said that he had intentions to create a franchise around the film if it was successful – and $2billion later, he confirmed that sequels were in the work in 2010.
        
        Since though, there’s been several push-backs and hiccups along the way. At one point the film was due out in December 2014, and has since been pencilled in for several different release dates for it only to be continually pushed back.
        
        
        Most of this has come down to production hurdles as well as the expansion of the franchise. Originally slated to become a trilogy, two extra films were added to the schedule, bringing the total to five. Namely, Cameron has insisted that he wanted to finish planning and writing every instalment in the franchise, and now that Avatar 5’s script is finally completed – production on number two can begin.
        
        Where will it be filmed?
        The film was shot in New Zealand – but has come at a steep price. The film studio had to commit to over $500million in costs and agree to host a world premiere in Wellington, New Zealand as dictated by the government.
        
        What is the title of Avatar 2?
        The long awaited sequel was finally given the name Avatar: The Way Of Water, 13 years after the release of the first film at CinemaCon in Las Vegas
        
        When can we expect the first official trailer for Avatar 2?
        Advertisement
        The first full-length trailer has finally arrived – you can watch it below.
        
        The two-and-a-half-minute clip welcomes fans back to the alien planet of Pandora, as well reintroducing the returning Na’vi characters played by Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana.
        
        Prior to this, a short teaser was previously released at CinemaCon in Las Vegas, where spectators were given 3D glasses for a clip which contained almost no dialogue and saw viewers immersed in different regions across the world of Pandora.
        
        The footage also showed the local tribe of Na’vi interacting with various species resembling whales and pelicans, some of which flew through the screen and into audience member’s faces thanks to the three-dimensional technology.
        
        Cameron appeared in a pre-recorded video to tell viewers the sequel is “designed for the biggest screen and the most immersive 3D available,” adding that he “set out to test the limits of what cinema can do.”
        
        In addition to the newly released trailer, the film has now also unveiled its official poster, along with a couple of brand-new images`,

      description:`What does work-life balance mean ?
      Healthy work-life balance refers to maintaining a harmonious relationship between your work and personal life. It involves consciously managing your time and energy to meet both professional and personal commitments while prioritizing self-care and well-being. 
      
      In an ideal world, this line of thinking goes: after work, we’re able to spend time on things that nourish us as people. This could involve spending time with friends and family or engaging in a hobby.
      
      Some characteristics of a healthy work-life balance may include:
      
      Setting boundaries: This involves establishing clear boundaries between work and personal life by defining specific working hours and separating work-related tasks from personal activities.
      Time management: Efficiently organizing and prioritizing tasks, ensuring that you allocate enough time for work responsibilities as well as personal pursuits, such as spending time with family, engaging in hobbies, or pursuing personal goals
      Stress management: Implementing strategies to manage stress levels, such as practicing mindfulness, engaging in regular physical activity, taking breaks, and unplugging from work-related activities when needed
      Flexibility: Having the ability to adapt and adjust your schedule to accommodate unforeseen circumstances or personal needs without jeopardizing work commitments
      Why is work-life balance so important?
      Just like in our diets, to stay healthy and energized for the long haul, people need variety. When it comes to work-life balance, people need to engage in a variety of activities and rest. We tend to fall into the trap of believing that we can be productive all the time, or that an eight-hour day at work equates to eight hours of output. However, that is hard, if not impossible, for many individuals to achieve.
      
      Plus, overworking has negative consequences for both employees and employers.
      
      Workaholics and those who struggle to practice self-care find themselves at higher risk for burnout, fatigue, and stress-related health issues. Poor work-life balance can also leave employees working more hours but being less productive.
      
       
      New call-to-action
      What is an unhealthy work-life balance?
      On the other hand, an unhealthy work-life balance occurs when work becomes overwhelming and takes precedence over personal life, leading to negative consequences for an individual's well-being. Some signs of an unhealthy work-life balance may include:
      
      Constant overwork: Regularly working long hours, including weekends and holidays, without sufficient time for rest, relaxation, or personal activities
      Neglected personal life: Sacrificing personal relationships, hobbies, and leisure activities due to excessive work demands
      Burnout: Experiencing physical, mental, and emotional exhaustion due to chronic stress and work-related pressure
      Lack of self-care: Failing to prioritize self-care activities, such as exercise, adequate sleep, and leisure time resulting in deteriorating physical and mental health
      Strained relationships: Experiencing difficulties in maintaining healthy relationships with family, friends, and loved ones due to work-related commitments
      Remember, achieving a healthy work-life balance may vary from person to person, depending on individual circumstances and preferences. It's important to find a balance that works for you and promotes your overall well-being.`,

      Indie labels, majors, and artist management companies all have some kind of relationship with music blogs. The main reason is that music blogs are very influential.
      
      They create a lot of buzz around music releases, and a few good blog placements can drive up streaming numbers and social media followers. Although music blogs review big-name artist releases, a lot of indie music blogs emerging artists.
      
      Music blogs love hearing fresh and exciting new music. So, as an independent artist or producer, you are on a level playing field with big artists.
      
      What Is A Music Blog?
      A music blog is just a blog dedicated to music topics. You can get new music blogs that share up and coming releases, music review blogs that review new releases and educational music blogs.
      
      Most music blogs share music streaming options, music videos, album artwork, and publish interviews with artists. It is a place where passionate music lovers can go to discover new (independent) music and artists.
      
      Blogs also curate their own playlists on platforms like Spotify, YouTube and SoundCloud. So, not only is your music reviewed and introduced to a wide audience but it is also placed on their playlists.
      
      A lot of music blogs don’t make money. They might generate some income from advertising, or they might earn something from a few big features commissioned by record labels or artist management companies.

      Pitching Your Music To The Top Music Blogs
      Top Music Blogs
      Before you send music to blogs, you need to do your homework. 
      
      Research the type(s) of blogs that will review your genre of music. If your music doesn’t suit a blog’s tastes, don’t waste your time or theirs by pitching your music to them.
      
      If you are a Folk singer-songwriter, there is no point reaching out to Hip Hop music blogs or pop music blogs. Only pitch to blogs that review your genre of music. 
      
      Instead of Googling and hoping for the best, using tools like Hype Machine can really streamline the research process. Hype Machine is a website that features all of the latest music from top music blogs around the world.
      
      The blogs are organised into a feed that you can browse. In their own words, “Hype Machine indexes hundreds of music sites”.
      
      To find blogs that are likely to review your music, all you have to do is browse the feed for relevant music.
      
      Then, simply take note of the blog that the music came from, visit the blog’s website, and search for a music submission page. Hype Machine also has a ‘By Genre’ filter you can use to narrow down your searches!`,

      description:`Hockey is a term used to denote a family of various types of both summer and winter team sports which originated on either an outdoor field, sheet of ice, or dry floor such as in a gymnasium. While these sports vary in specific rules, numbers of players, apparel, and playing surface, they share broad characteristics of two opposing teams using a stick to propel a ball or disk into a goal.

      There are many types of hockey. Some games make the use of skates, either wheeled, or bladed while others do not. In order to help make the distinction between these various games, the word hockey is often preceded by another word i.e. field hockey, ice hockey, roller hockey, rink hockey, or floor hockey.
      
      In each of these sports, two teams play against each other by trying to manoeuvre the object of play, either a type of ball or a disk (such as a puck), into the opponent's goal using a hockey stick. Two notable exceptions use a straight stick and an open disk (still referred to as a puck) with a hole in the center instead. The first case is a style of floor hockey whose rules were codified in 1936 during the Great Depression by Canada's Sam Jacks. The second case involves a variant which was later modified in roughly the 1970s to make a related game that would be considered suitable for inclusion as a team sport in the newly emerging Special Olympics. The floor game of gym ringette, though related to floor hockey, is not a true variant due to the fact that it was designed in the 1990s and modelled off of the Canadian ice skating team sport of ringette, which was invented in Canada in 1963. Ringette was also invented by Sam Jacks, the same Canadian who codified the rules for the open disk style of floor hockey 1936.
      
      Certain sports which share general characteristics with the forms of hockey, but are not generally referred to as hockey include lacrosse, hurling, camogie, and shinty.`,

     `When fellow plus size shoppers ask me the best way to find style inspiration 
      or cute clothes, I always say social media. Following stylish plus size women on Instagram
      has been key to my own personal style journey and has led me to more unique pieces (and confidence) than anything else. I fill my feed with plus size bloggers and influencers, but also pretty much anyone who posts their outfits regularly and happens to be over a size 10 or 12. Despite all its frustrations (insert angry rant about the algorithm here), Instagram has been a godsend for plus size fashion lovers in this way. It is a place that has provided community and an inspiration to those who don’t often see bodies that look like theirs reflected in advertisements, magazines, or television.
      When I’m wondering what to buy, I go to the plus size fashion community on Instagram. That’s why I decided to ask a handful of plus size women what the best pieces of clothing they’ve purchased so far in 2019 have been. There were a few surprises, a few brands that kept being mentioned again and again, and a lot of items that I’ve now added to my to-buy list. If you’re plus size and wondering what pieces to invest in right now, here’s some inspiration from 11 women who have found pieces they just can’t live without.

      description:`Apple presented the Vision Pro as a pro-level product with all the technology built into the device. It’s fully stand-alone and does not seem to be able to be used as a screen for your laptop or iPhone. However, Apple’s WWDC presentation demonstrated how iOS apps, movies, and images would appear superimposed onto one’s surrounding environment using the Vision Pro.

      Apple’s strategy is always to try to sell you an additional expensive product. For instance, it has never created an all-in-one laptop that would also be a tablet. If you wanted a tablet, you bought an iPad; if you wanted a notebook, you bought a MacBook.
      
      Initially, Apple mostly highlighted the Vision Pro’s video-playing capabilities and experience. The device is VR and game capable, but Apple doesn’t yet have VR content, and its platforms aren’t known for gaming capability. Vision Pro uses hand gestures to operate, with no controller, which suggests that if Apple does get into gaming, you will have to buy a controller accessory to make it work.
      
      The voice part of the Vision Pro, which will be critical, is not yet cooked. Since Apple is not yet at the forefront of generative AI, I would expect some issues getting that capability to work. However, the eye and hand elements appear to be mature in comparison.
      
      Vision Pro doesn’t look like it will work well with glasses, though contacts will be fine, and the price for an adaptive lens for the device is estimated to be between $300 and $600 extra if you need vision correction.
      
      It fits very tightly against your face. There is no top support, but initial testers have complained that the pads may mark your face and the pressure can get annoying after extended use, like when watching a movie.
      
      Videos should be impressive with 4K displays for each eye, and that tight fit keeps out ambient light. It has a digital crown, kind of like a watch, that allows you to control your level of immersion and potentially blends what the cameras on the device see with the content so you can see what is happening around you — though I wouldn’t wear these walking or driving.`,

      description:`Happy Friday the 13th, Jason! Here’s every ‘Friday The 13th’ movie – ranked!

      Although originally devised to simply cash in on the wave of spooky-day-related buzz following the success of John Carpenter‘s seminal slasher Halloween, Jason Voorhees ended up giving Halloween‘s Michael Myers a run for his money when Sean S. Cunningham’s Friday the 13th was released, flinging the barn doors wide open for The Camp Crystal Lake Killer to emerge as a horror icon in his own right.
      
      The ensuing franchise might not have proven too popular with movie critics but it went on to amass a huge fanbase, becoming the highest-grossing franchise in horror history until the release of Universal and Blumhouse’s direct sequel to the original Halloween just last year.
      
      WATCH
      Over the years, audiences have been treated to a grand total of ten bonafide sequels, one crossover and one reboot with each new entry implementing a number or adjustments – some more subtle and others just plain unfathomably bizarre – to lure fans back for more. As a result, the Friday The 13th franchise has had its maximum highs and its ultimate lows over the better part of four decades, as our ranking of the entire franchise proves below…
      
      12. JASON X (2001) – Jason in space. The shittest one by a light year
      Advertisement
      What happens: Jason Voorhees returns with a space nanobot facelift and a brand new machete, but his murderous attitude hasn’t changed one iota when he is awakened on a spaceship in a far away future.
      
      What’s new: With the franchise having been milked for all it was worth by now, the Friday the 13th cow was running on curd fumes. So what did they come up with? A space opera slasher, of course.
      
      Where’s Jason? Jason was captured by the US government in 2010 and held at the Crystal Lake Research Facility in the hopes of killing him off scientifically. Following a barrage of failed attempts, the government gives him the Han Solo frozen stasis treatment only for his cryogenic pod to be discovered all of 447 years later.`,
